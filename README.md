# Code Review Club

The aim of the Code Review Club is multi-fold:
- To help improve the quality of academic code written in the School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol
- To give chemistry students and PDRAs experience reviewing code and having their code reviewed
- To improve collaboration and interaction across the School of Chemistry

The Code Review Club will meet fortnightly to discuss code review practices, talk about their scientific applications, and to **review each others code**. 

## Expectations

- Treat everyone with respect and always try to offer constructive criticism
- Reciprocate code review; if someone has looked at your pull request, return the favour
- The code that you will review may be part of a yet unpublished scientific work -- treat it with confidence
- If your code is in a private repository, you must give 

The expectation is that your efforts to review anothers will be reciprocated by others.
