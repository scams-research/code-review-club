# Code Review Club

The aim of the Code Review Club is multi-fold:
- To help improve the quality of academic code written in the School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol
- To give chemistry students and PDRAs experience reviewing code and having their code reviewed
- To improve collaboration and interaction across the School of Chemistry

The Code Review Club will meet fortnightly to discuss code review practices, talk about their scientific applications, and **review each other's code**. 

## Guidelines

- Treat everyone with respect and always try to offer constructive criticism
- Reciprocate code review; if someone has looked at your pull request, return the favour
- The code that you will review may be part of a yet unpublished scientific work -- treat it with confidence
- If you are reviewing code in a private repository, you may need to be given collaborator access -- treat this access with the utmost respect
- You may need to be willing to give others access to your private repository
- If code reviewed by a colleague is used in an academic publication it is expected that the reviewer will be acknowledged by name

The Code Review Club aspires to be a friendly, respectful community; if you are found to act against these expectations, you will be asked to leave.
